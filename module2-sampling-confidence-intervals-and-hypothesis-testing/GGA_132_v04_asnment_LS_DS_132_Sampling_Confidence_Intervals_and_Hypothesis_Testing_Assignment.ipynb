        "\n",
        "A confidence interval refers to a neighborhood around some point estimate, the size of which is determined by the desired p-value. For instance, we might say that 52% of Americans prefer tacos to burritos, with a 95% confidence interval of +/- 5%.\n",
        "\n",
        "52% (0.52) is the point estimate, and +/- 5% (the interval $[0.47, 0.57]$) is the confidence interval. \"95% confidence\" means a p-value $\\leq 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, the confidence interval includes $0.5$ - which is the natural null hypothesis (that half of Americans prefer tacos and half burritos, thus there is no clear favorite). So in this case, we could use the confidence interval to report that we've failed to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "\n",
        "But providing the full analysis with a confidence interval, including a graphical representation of it, can be a helpful and powerful way to tell your story. Done well, it is also more intuitive to a layperson than simply saying \"fail to reject the null hypothesis\" - it shows that in fact the data does *not* give a single clear result (the point estimate) but a whole range of possibilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "How is a confidence interval built, and how should it be interpreted? It does *not* mean that 95% of the data lies in that interval - instead, the frequentist interpretation is \"if we were to repeat this experiment 100 times, we would expect the average result to lie in this interval ~95 times.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "For a 95% confidence interval and a normal(-ish) distribution, you can simply remember that +/-2 standard deviations contains 95% of the probability mass, and so the 95% confidence interval based on a given sample is centered at the mean (point estimate) and has a range of +/- 2 (or technically 1.96) standard deviations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Different distributions/assumptions (90% confidence, 99% confidence) will require different math, but the overall process and interpretation (with a frequentist approach) will be the same.\n",

        "\n",
        "One way of looking at a P-value, is that it is a kind of magnifying glass that amplifies noise vs. signal. Why would you want such a thing? Whenever you are wondering how much 'noise' there is in a set of data, how much noise there is an an argument being touted on the news, you find yourself to be very interested in how much noise is hidden here or there or swept under the carpet or left out of that dubious looking graph with unlabeled axis units. If you had such a noise-descriminating, noise-amplifying magnifying class (e.g. by using squares you amplify the noisy patterns), you could look through and see how much of the data was noiseless. \n",
        "\n",
        "With a slight bit of reification, the P-value is just such a magnifying glass, it gives you a kind of 'margin of noise,' which you can translate into a % reliability, with the standard translation of decimal to percent: a P-Value of .05 is 5% likely noise, or 95% noiseless or 95% confidence. Is a given confidence % good enough? Does that easily translate into inverses and generalizations beyond continued narrow observation prediction? There are both clear practical uses and nuanced debates and disagreements.\n",
