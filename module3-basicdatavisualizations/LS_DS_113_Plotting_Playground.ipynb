Take 59 and exit Greenbriar like you are going to Church 2. First light is Bissonnet, make a left on Bissonnet. 3. Stay on Bissonnet for about 1/2 mile. On the right you will see a gray apartment complex called \"Maryland Manor\". The street right there is \"Ashby\", make a right on Ashby. 4. The first left is Wroxton Court. I am in the upstairs of the duplex at 1714 Wroxton Court, but you probably will just want to walk around to the back yard. My phone no. is case there are any problems is (713) 529-1038.

They are in Word, but please let me know if you have problems with the attachments. I can convert them or fax them to you. I have made notes on the recipes regarding the advisability of doubling some of them for a party of more than 8 guests. At the bottom of this email, you can still review Alicia's original instructions and comments about the parties (and the guest lists as they stand now). My only thoughts about dividing up the recipes among your guests are: 1. Remind everyone to bring a bottle of wine for the group. 2. The dessert recipe should perhaps not be given to a single male as it requires a springform pan (an item I'm guessing is not common to most bachelor kitchens). 3. The person(s) to bring the soup should also bring bread. 4. Remind the people doing the main course to do a mixture of pork & chicken. Let me know if you have any questions!

Our research has revealed no statements of regulators in Japan in connection with the marketing or dealing in the above types of products through the internet or other electronic systems from publicly available source.

We do not have any specific laws or regulations which would marketing or trading of any of the products set out in question 1 above through the internet. Under Japanese law, formation of any contract does not require any formality. Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers or acceptances to be valid as such. There is no Statute of Frauds, and parties may make most types of contracts orally. If there is enough evidence establishing that the offeree agreed to the terms offered, an offeror may rely on it. In most simple sales contracts for consumer goods, for example, it would be easy to prove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y. The Seller's electronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy product Y should be enough in this context. In more complicated contracts, the structure of the seller's Web pages should be carefully designed. Having no court decisions, we have no definite answer to the question of enforceability of shrink-wrap agreements in Japan. However, the legal implications of the Web-wrap, the online version of shrink-wrap, may be somewhat different from shrink-wraps (e.g. licenses for software sold over the counter). Under a typical shrink-wrap license in the real world, for example, the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases the product. However, in an on-line environment, a customer has a choice to click on an Accept-to-Buy icon before the customer purchases the product. Further, with a carefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able to let the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on the icon, it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms and conditions than in a typical shrink-wrap license situation. Unlike shrink-wrap in the real world, the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that the customer clicked on the icon. Given these differences, the result possibly may be more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrink-wrap licenses. If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under U.S. or U.K. law and the transactions contain a choice of such law, such transactions, including the choice of law, will be enforceable in Japan. > > 3.

This is the first time I have read email over the weekend. Yes, Mark and I will host Church Gourmet at 7 p.m. on Saturday, May 13. Does everyone have a dish to bring? Do we need to help Ulf with the chicken and pork or something else? Let me know. I will contact my folks if you will contact yours. Peace, Beth Our address is 4605 Willowbend Blvd. We are in between Post Oak and Stella Link just south of the 610 South Loop. Directions from Christ the King: (There are many ways to get to our house, but I will give freeway directions.) From the church parking lot take Rice Blvd west to Kirby. Turn right (north) on Kirby until you get to 59. Get on 59 going south and exit the 610 loop going south. 610 will pass Meyerland Plaza on the right. At the same point where 610 turns headed east, take the Post Oak exit going south and get in the far left lane (do not exit at West Bellfort). Willowbend Blvd. will be the first stoplight. Turn left. After the first stoplight our house will be on the right. You may park in our driveway or on the street (it is legal after 6 p.m.) or in the turn around space in the medians (just make sure there is room for cars to pass).

Mid Year PRC is around the corner and we must start preparing for it. In preparation for the upcoming Mid Year Review Process, we will need your assistance with the Communication to your groups! Therefore, we, the Human Resources Team for ENA, are requesting your assistance in generating all the communication materials needed to your group to make sure we don't leave anyone uninformed. The first two pieces of communication coming your way, besides the e-mail announcements that have recently been distributed, is the ever so famous Quick Reference Guides & the new PEP cards. This time around, the Global Performance Mgmt team has decided not to have so many hard copies distributed of the Quick Reference Guides because you are receiving the e-mail version copy, as you will find attached below. The reason behind this is that ENA has been through this process for the last few years and the Quick Reference Guides contain alot of the same information as in the past, and seem to come in much more handy for employees tha are new to the company and to the process. Next, the Global Perf Mgmt team has created this nifty PEP Card that has very minimal highlighted information for everyone. Please anticipate the PEP Cards in your group this Friday afteroon. We will also get out a few hard Copies of the Reference Guides, but again, it is attached below, so please don't anticipate a copy of the Quick Reference Guides for everyone in your group. We will be sending a follow up e-mail to you all to advise you of the schedule for any training classes that will be available before the Performance Mgmt system opens on May 15th. We ask that you assist us in this process by distributing detailed e-mails such as this (addressed to all the Admn Asst's) to your group. Your assistance and cooperation is critical, but most importantly greatly appreciated. Please feel free to contact your HR rep with any questions you may have, and also, the PEP Hotline is already currently available to provide all employees with Perf Mgmt Assistance. Thanks again.

I need to respond to EnronOnline Friday with my approvals to this list. The list is broken up into 3 groups, Group 1 being counterparties already opened up for online trading (so you don't need to re-review), Group 2 being counterparties that we have correct names and credit on (you need to review this list which has about 100 counterparties), and Group 3 being counterparties that we have bad names or no approved credit yet ( so you don't need to approve this list). You may ask, what products will these counterparties trade? They can potentially trade all the products we offer online so you need to look at them like any new counterparty. Saying that, what we really expect them to trade is the Singapore based group of products. ----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 05/10/2000 01:43 PM ----- Frank L Davis 05/10/2000 01:09 PM To: Karen Lambert/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Japanese Approvals ---------------------- Forwarded by Frank L Davis/HOU/ECT on 05/10/2000 01:09 PM --------------------------- From: Tom Moran 05/10/2000 12:05 PM To: Frank L Davis/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Japanese Approvals Frank, Please call me so that we can go over this list before disbursing it to the other groups.

(You might want to check the full names of Mitsui Global Precious Metals, Itocho Oil Exploration, IBJ-DL Financial Technology and Nippon Oil Exploration, they don't appear complete.) There is a tax treaty between Australia and Japan hence no further tax checks required. I note that BHP Japan is listed. BHP is an Australian based corporation. Whilst there would be no Australian legal impediment I would question why they would be trading global products through a Japanese subsidary.

I have now found the e-mail that I had previously sent to Houston with regard to the inability of certain US entities, including Utilicorp, to issue a guarantee for overseas entities unless they obtain FERC and the state regulators approval beforehand. United gas have now changed their name to Aquila Energy Ltd and are looking to expand in to power in the UK as well as gas and power throughout Europe. Therefore, I expect our level of business is likely to increase in the near future. It is now even more important that we either obtain a guarantee from Utilicorp, or, ensure that if Utilicorp co- sign any agreement that it is enforceable. I would be very grateful if you could a) confirm that it is not possible for Utilicorp (and for that matter Entergy) top parent to issue a parent company guarantee without obtaining authorisation form various regulatory bodies. b) that obtaining the signature of an authorised officer of Utilicorp on each agreement (or master) is enforceable.

You are correct, it does have something to do with the international operations only. The way Entergy explained the situation, there was some sort of Act 'The 1935 Public Utility Holding Company Act -section 53 or 58 I believe - which says that you have to be own adjacent utilities (adjacent States?) to be able to issue guarantees in respect of international operations (very strange!). In other words, if the company owns utilities that are not in adjacent states, as is the case of 'Entergy', then the utility has to segregate their business between domestic and non domestic business, thus the domestic assets cannot be used as security / guarantee for the international assets. Whilst I do not have any reason to doubt what Entergy say, I would like some confirmation that there is no way to by-pass this Act. Is there someone in legal Houston that you could run this by?

I have requested a Parent Company Guarantee from Entergy Corp but have been advised that this in not available due to regulatory reasons but they are prepared to provide a guarantee from Entergy Power Development Corp which holds their overseas generation assets. Whilst the proposed guarantor has some degree of financial substance, it would only support restricted short term trades and as this entity is not rated, does not lend itself easily to MAC language in the contract. I would be grateful if you could confirm whether there are such regulations that would prevent Entergy Corp from providing us with a guarantee to support this UK entity.

I spoke to their lawyer, Kim Bowers, who is very nice, and she asked us to make our comments to their form by email. After talking to Tanya while you were out, it appears that we need to revisit their credit situation since the credit under our existing master swap is quite old.

The knee-jerk reaction might be to assume that these developments will widen the current economic disparities. The latest technology is also the most expensive, and so it follows that only those who are economically secure will have access to it. Those who are struggling financially will be left behind even further than they already were. What we need is a creative economy to fuel our magnificence as a society. Enron Investment Partners seeks to deliver on this by giving small, minority-owned businesses a much-needed push in the direction of financial stability.

We have a Master Swap contract with these guys, and they are an ESP. However, their exposure is well above the contractual threshold ($6.5MM credit line versus $12MM exposure) and we are not collateralized for the amount of exposure above the credit line. So, as a result, we want to approve them for online trading, but we actually do not want them to be able to complete any transactions. The counterparty has requested approval, and Fred Lagrasta has asked that we approve them so they can get online and see the stacks. Credit does not want them to complete trades, so we need to set a very low credit line for online trading so when the counterparty attempts to trade (if they attempt to trade), is turned down. If this is not possible, please ket me know so I can get back with Fred and the counterparty. Thanks, John, jones-t, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , false\n",

Do any changes need to be made to our arbitration language? I have enclosed what we currently use. Also, should we keep in waiver of jury trial even if arbitration is chosen for situations where the award needs to be enforced in court? Is it necessary to have a statement that the award can be enforced in court? 2. We have assumed that there is no need to add our appointment of process agent language if our counterparty is either organized in the US or Canada or maintains a branch or office in the US or Canada. Is this a correct assumption? Enclosed is our process agent language. I look forward to hearing from you.

We have a Master Swap contract with these guys, and they are an ESP. However, their exposure is well above the contractual threshold ($6.5MM credit line versus $12MM exposure) and we are not collateralized for the amount of exposure above the credit line. So, as a result, we want to approve them for online trading, but we actually do not want them to be able to complete any transactions. The counterparty has requested approval, and Fred Lagrasta has asked that we approve them so they can get online and see the stacks. Credit does not want them to complete trades, so we need to set a very low credit line for online trading so when the counterparty attempts to trade (if they attempt to trade), is turned down. If this is not possible, please ket me know so I can get back with Fred and the counterparty. Thanks, John, jones-t, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , false\n",

From a legal sign off perspective, we should be able to give the immediate all clear, provided in the case of a ref entity, that it is not an existing customer/counterparty of Enron (if it is we'll need to check confidentiality agreements etc). We'll need to work out the quickest way of establishing this (but it is not per se a legal task) in the case of a ref entity, that we have carried out the necessary the legal due diligence in its country of establishment/location in the case of a counterparty, that we have carried out the necessary legal due diligence in its country of establishment/location Of course our legal due diligence may require us to take additional steps in the case of some countries/counterparties, but we will address these steps as generically as possible. Hope this gives a sense of where we're coming from. Please call me to discuss further if need be.

The ones from Legal seem to be straightforward enough. We need however to discuss how they should be implemented to make all parties satisfied. Credit: Could we discuss your requirements for immediate clearance. Finally, we need to establish on which platform these approvals will be managed. The Approval Form that I sent around previously is acceptable for ad hoc request (or at least with the current level of requests), but going forward I think that we will require some kind of database, may be like the EOL counterparty database. In the meantime, I will send out procedures for the introduction of the Approval Form. Regards Tomas I think that the \"general policies\" route is the right (and only) one - particularly for the vast number of reference entities envisaged. From a legal sign off perspective, we should be able to give the immediate all clear, provided in the case of a ref entity, that it is not an existing customer/counterparty of Enron (if it is we'll need to check confidentiality agreements etc). We'll need to work out the quickest way of establishing this (but it is not per se a legal task) in the case of a ref entity, that we have carried out the necessary the legal due diligence in its country of establishment/location in the case of a counterparty, that we have carried out the necessary legal due diligence in its country of establishment/location Of course our legal due diligence may require us to take additional steps in the case of some countries/counterparties, but we will address these steps as generically as possible. Hope this gives a sense of where we're coming from. Please call me to discuss further if need be. Paul, jones-t, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , false\n",

My fingers are bare to the bone, the blood is oozing out of them.......I have been typing my- watootsie off -reviewing counterparty's, oh gotta run, the Queen is calling me for lunch. Ahh I am back, she is such a suite lady... Regarding the Keyspan issue, I received a request from Maureen Smith about a month ago to set up a GISB with ENA and these Ravenswood entites. At the same time they sent us a guaranty which ENA -Physical Legal was reviewing, this is the first I have heard they want to transact financially. Ravenswood is a CoGen facility that operates in New York City, I am assuming they want to buy gas to operate the plant and hedge the gas at the same time. KeySpan Corp is the holding company, and also owns two regualted utilities that serve the NY metro area, one of which is Brooklyn Union Gas ( now named KeySpan Energy Delivery). I am fine with these Ravenswood trading financially as long as they meet the ESP requirements, and becuase they will be guaranteed by KeySpan Corp I am assuming they will. Also, regarding KeySpan Energy Management, that guaranty includes KeySpan Energy Services as well but only cover Physical transactions. I don't see any need, at this time, to include them on this Ravenswood guaranty as we have not exposure their at all. Hope this helps, Cheer-io, Russell From: Tana Jones on 05/23/2000 04:40 PM To: Russell Diamond/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Subject: Keyspan I understand that you are the Keyspan man!!

We are taking measures to try to prevent this e-mail from entering our system, but in the event you see it, please delete the email immediately and report it to your IT support analyst. Please note the following Enron Policies regarding viruses: Email Malicious Code (Virus) Screening In addition to the Enron requirement for email attachments (received and sent) to be screened for malicious code (viruses, Trojan Horses, etc.), users of Enron information resources are required to detach email attachments that are received on to their hard drive for local virus screening purposes. All executables (*.bat, *exe, *.com, *.vbs) files should never be launched from email without first consulting with IT. Virus Alerts The Internet is constantly being flooded with information about computer viruses and Trojan Horses. However, within among real virus notices are computer virus hoaxes. While these hoaxes do not infect systems, they are still time consuming and costly to handle. It only wastes bandwidth and unnecessarily alarms other computer users. Please, do not perpetuate unconfirmed warnings about viruses and Trojan Horses. If you receive an invalidated warning, don't pass it to all your friends, pass it to your IT computer security manager to validate first.

In reply: 1. We will change United Kingdom to England in the governing law section. 2. and 3. We did switch to the English law form and our form didn't provide for using securities as collateral. As you point out, it is likely that SR will always be in the money and the CSA provides for an unlimited Threshold for SR at all times so that it will never be providing collateral under that document. There are certainly other changes that could be made to the document with that in mind but in the interest of time we didn't make much of an effort on that score - our theory was that you wouldn't mind too much since you would never have to post anything under this document. Please let me know if you have any other questions or comments. Mark \"Stephen Kruft\" <Stephen_Kruft@swissre.com> 05/31/2000 08:56 AM To: mark.taylor@enron.com cc: Subject: BWT Transaction I looked at the EFR-ENA Schedule in connection with Gordon Boozer's comments. I see no problems except: 1. The document is expressed to be governed by the law of the\"United Kingdom.\" I have never seen this formulation and think it should say \"England,\" as I believe there are in fact multiple legal systems (e.g., Scottish) within the U.K. 2. I am not sure why all collateral except LCs was deleted. Was this agreed by EFR? If so, OK. If not, could the CSA provide for other collateral as Gordon requested. It is unusual for SR entities to use LCs in non-reinsurance situations and would probably cost them less to post Treasuries. Here it is of course unlikely that EFR will have to post anything, since EFR will always be in the money to some extent. 3. Did you switch to the English law form of CSA?

We also added in an alternative \"Credit Support Amount\" provision on the front page of the ISDA credit support annex to deal with situations when we do not want to return the Credit Support Amount during the term of the Master Agreement. We moved the guaranty forms (Enron Corp. and Counterparty) as a separate document(s) in the attorney forms bank, atty.fms/current forms/guaranty.doc. The guaranty form was revised to (1) make it cover both confirms and masters so we don't need two separate forms on an ongoing basis, and (2) we changed the procedures for timing of demands made on Enron (deleting the 15 day period). We are also discussing adding an assignment provision to the Enron Corp. guaranty with Clement and will keep you posted.

With this email Global Counterparty can open the counterparty. We then immediately send the master swap agreement and other documentation down in the attached memo. If we get the master in signed but we're waiting on critical additional documentation (like the guaranty or perhaps a legal opinion on a governmental) we hold off on sending the email. Sometimes the file may not be complete because we are waiting on incumbency certificates (which we do not consider critical in most circumstances) so we may send the email, send down whatever executed documentation we have, while we wait on the certificates. We used to wait to send the executed documents down until we had the whole package completed, but they can't approve the counterparty without getting the master. Does this make sense?... I am now going to look for one with special instructions... Below is my standard memo to Global Contract with any kind of executed documents I send down to them. Also, a new procedral thing that is evolving here in Houston, we used to send Global Contracts the originally executed guarantees, but Credit is not the gatekeeper and recordkeeper of all guarantees so we will be sending the originals to them in the future (with a copy in the Global Contract file) ----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 06/01/2000 10:56 AM ----- Susan Flynn 04/22/2000 10:52 AM To: Jefferson D Sorenson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Laurel Adams/HOU/ECT@ECT, Andrea R Guillen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Larry Joe Hunter/HOU/ECT@ECT, David P Dupre/HOU/ECT@ECT, Chris Walker/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jarrod Cyprow/HOU/ECT@ECT, Pamela Sonnier/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sheetal Patel/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jean Bell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Harry Bucalo/HOU/ECT@ECT, Charlie Hoang/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bob Bowen/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, Debbie R Brackett/HOU/ECT@ECT, Nidia Mendoza/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tanya Rohauer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Brant Reves/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rod Nelson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russell Diamond/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tracy Ngo/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Suttle/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tracy Ngo/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lesli Campbell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Molly Harris/HOU/ECT@ECT, Christopher Smith/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom Moran/HOU/ECT@ECT, Molly Harris/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kevin P Radous/HOU/ECT@ECT, Veronica Espinoza/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Edward Sacks/Corp/Enron@Enron, Marie Heard/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan Bailey/HOU/ECT@ECT, Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary Solmonson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Marilyn Colbert/HOU/ECT@ECT, Yolanda Cordova-Gilbert/HOU/ECT@ECT, Diane Ellstrom/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lynn E Shivers/HOU/ECT@ECT, Willie Harrell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bill D Hare/HOU/ECT@ect, Jason Moore/HOU/ECT@ECT, Leslie Reeves/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dianne Seib/CAL/ECT@ECT, Samuel Schott/HOU/ECT@ECT, Anthony Campos/HOU/ECT@ECT, Julie Meyers/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mary G Gosnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bernice Rodriguez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Connie Sutton/HOU/ECT@ECT, Karen Lambert/HOU/ECT@ECT, Willie Harrell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Anthony Campos/HOU/ECT@ECT, Carrie Southard/HOU/ECT@ECT, Frank L Davis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sheri Thomas/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lisa Gillette/HOU/ECT@ECT, Amber Ebow/HOU/ECT@ECT, Adnan Patel/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: The Tranzonic Companies We have received the following executed Master Agreement: Type of Contract: ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) Effective Date: March 21, 2000 Enron Entity: Enron North America Corp.

We transacted with Twister last week and I had sent you a credit worksheet for the transaction. Twister is a broker who transacts on behalf of small E&P companies, and in this case, the E&P agreed to post the L/C we quoted for the transaction. After talking to Sara, it sounds like we are going to go ahead and send a confirmation to Twister for the deal and attach to the confirmation an assignment of the deal from Twister to Sanguine. It is my understanding that both Terry and Todd will need to sign both the confirmation and the assignment, so I think we will need to carefully coordinate the steps through the Confirmation Desk (Sheetal Patel). I have attached a worksheet for the transaction (Sanguine agreed to post $500K). Please coordinate with Sara, Sheetal and me in getting this out. The contact information at Sanguine is: Todd Tharp Manager of Gas Contracts Sanguine, Ltd. 1861 East 71st Street South Tulsa, Ok 74136 Thanks, John, jones-t, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , false\n",

Tracy can ask Kelly about trying to get something in place. The others can probably wait until we get some of the above executed. Dynegy and Sempra are probably the most important of those left. Dynegy should not be too difficult; however, Sempra is a master financial/physical and will be more problematic. Let me know if you have any questions.

The following is a list of the exchanges on which we trade: International Petroleum Exchange Amsterdam Power Exchange N.V. (APX) UK Pool Spanish Pool(Mercadeo de electricidad - Omel) I have the regulation books for the IPE let me know if you want a copy and I will arrange to have it copied and couriered however it is an etremely thick binder with numerous additional updates it may be better to visit the IPE website. In relation to the Spanish Pool I have the documents that Enron Espana Energia SL and Enron Energie GmbH signed when they joined the Spanish Pool however these are all in Spanish so will not provide much help it would be better to visit the website 'www.omel.es' where you'll find the Rules of the Pool and the Contract of Adhesion in English. With regard to the UK Pool there are twelve volumes each volume is on average 1,000 pages long the only person who has a copy of the rules is Paul Dawson here in London, if there is any particular area you were interested in looking at I would suggest contacting him on +44 207 783 5453. In relation to the Amsterdam Pool I have couriered a copy of the latest rules to you. Please let me know if you require further information.

Saturday, June 10th, portions of the Body Shop will be closed for approximately 90 days to build the pillar supports for the Enron Center Sky Bridge. This construction will necessitate the closure/relocation of Studio B, the free weight area and massage therapy services. Many of the Yoga, Tai Chi, and Abs Lab classes previously held in Studio B will be moved to Studio A. Because of space constraints the free weight area will be relocated to the Massage Therapy room and Massage Therapy services will be transferred to the Health Center on the 3rd floor of the Enron building for the duration of the construction project. A new class schedule is attached for your convenience. Thank you for your patience and understanding during this inconvenient yet necessary construction project.

The Bakersfield Californian - can only do newsprint swaps and options 2. CMS Marketing, Services and Trading - can enter into financial power transactions only if those transactions are fixed price swaps, basis swaps, swing swaps and options 3. Phibro, Inc. - can only do natural gas, crude oil or oil product energy prices swap, put & call options. Per my discussions with Tom, this counterparty is coming through on tonight's list as an amended counterparty because they want to do financial power. They have a really old form of agreement in place from 1993 and it does not allow power financial transactions. I spoke to Mark Taylor about this and he said if they want to do financial power they are going to have to replace this agreement with an ISDA. I am going to talk to Credit about this. They will definitely not be able to trade financial power by Monday... 4. PXRE Corporation - weather only 5. Swiss Re Financial Products Corporation - weather only 6.

Upon receipt of the fax Samantha will get it initialled by Mark Taylor and have it walked to either Louise Kitchen or Andy Zipper for signature (depending on who is in). Either of them can sign for all 3 companies, Louise as Managing Director, Andy as Vice President. After the agreement is fully executed Samantha will fax it to Rick Wagner at Continental (unless you give her instructions to the contrary).

The letter is non-specific as to name and title but since the work is for the Online Project, I would imagine that Philippe Bibi would be the appropriate person. I have not submitted the letter to Philippe for signature for two reasons: (1) We do not have the original Agreement for Project Services. I don't know who executed it but it is not in our files. (2) There are actually a couple of standard subcontractor agreements that we ask the Contractor and Sub-Contractor to execute. I am attaching electronic copies to this e-mail and printed copies to the hard copy which I am returning to you along with the original letter. If we find the person (Corporate Officer) who signed the original Agreement for Project Services, we should have that person sign all of these documents and then formally transmit them to the vendor. We need the original agreement before we can proceed. Please call me if I can be of help. The subcontractor agreements are attached below. gene, jones-t, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , false\n",

I believe that it is intended to eliminate any confusion that historically arose during the debate between \"First Method\" (one-way payments) and \"Second Method\" (two-way payments) for Early Termination purposes. Although I can't find a good reason to continue to use this provision with an ISDA (except that it emphasizes the point), I can understand why we may have added it to a pre-ISDA agreement with a governmental. The only example that I could locate was our September 21, 1995 Master Agreement with Reedy Creek Improvement District. For those of you who have never seen this form, it was one of the two types of master agreements developed by ECT before we became conversant with ISDA. Because these forms didn't contemplate municipal counterparties, we had to add many of the ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule provisions. The Part 5(b)(k) provision originally appeared in this early agreement. It was included in the \"Event of Change\" section [5F(4)] (which is tantamount to the ISDA concept of \"Illegality\", a \"Termination Event\"). I think it was probably included because in the ISDA, Second Method is the automatic payment method if the parties fail to make a specific designation for Early Termination purposes, but there isn't a comparable provision in the old ECT form., jones-t, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , false\n",

The letter is non-specific as to name and title but since the work is for the Online Project, I would imagine that Philippe Bibi would be the appropriate person. I have not submitted the letter to Philippe for signature for two reasons: (1) We do not have the original Agreement for Project Services. I don't know who executed it but it is not in our files. (2) There are actually a couple of standard subcontractor agreements that we ask the Contractor and Sub-Contractor to execute. I am attaching electronic copies to this e-mail and printed copies to the hard copy which I am returning to you along with the original letter. If we find the person (Corporate Officer) who signed the original Agreement for Project Services, we should have that person sign all of these documents and then formally transmit them to the vendor. We need the original agreement before we can proceed. Please call me if I can be of help.

We transacted with Twister last week and I had sent you a credit worksheet for the transaction. Twister is a broker who transacts on behalf of small E&P companies, and in this case, the E&P agreed to post the L/C we quoted for the transaction. After talking to Sara, it sounds like we are going to go ahead and send a confirmation to Twister for the deal and attach to the confirmation an assignment of the deal from Twister to Sanguine. It is my understanding that both Terry and Todd will need to sign both the confirmation and the assignment, so I think we will need to carefully coordinate the steps through the Confirmation Desk (Sheetal Patel). I have attached a worksheet for the transaction (Sanguine agreed to post $500K). Please coordinate with Sara, Sheetal and me in getting this out. The contact information at Sanguine is: Todd Tharp Manager of Gas Contracts Sanguine, Ltd. 1861 East 71st Street South Tulsa, Ok 74136 Thanks, John, jones-t, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , false\n",

First, about the approved products, as best as I can determine, we don't have the pulp & paper language in, and don't have the weather rep in. Seeing as tho' they probably won't trade pulp & paper, I won't worry about that. However, with respect to weather, since the weather rep is always added into the confirm, I don't think not having it in the master would necessarily mean they can't trade weather.

Second, looking at the agreement to see if there is anything else we want to mention to the general distribution group, I don't see anything in particular out of the ordinary with respect to trading issues, except in the Netting of Payments section which appears to allow payment netting amongst PG&E and it Core Procurement Department and California Gas Transmission Department. Will they be financially trading separately under those departments? And if so should we instruct the Settlements group to net the payments?

Secretary kicked us out of using their vault on 48 for originals because we had too many documents). I think it would be good practice if Legal and Credit sent the originals to the same place, so we will be able to find them when we want them. So my question to y'all is, do you think we should send them to Global Contracts, to you, or directly the the 48th floor vault (if they let us!)., jones-t, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , false\n",

The Kingpin Act blocks all property and interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction, owned or controlled by significant foreign narcotics traffickers as identified by President Clinton. The targets of this measure are major narcotics traffickers and trafficking organizations based in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Laos, Mexico, Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, Peru, Russia, and Thailand. U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in any transaction or dealing in property or interests in property of SDNTKs and from engaging in any transaction that evades or avoids the prohibition of the Kingpin Act. These prohibitions affect trade transactions as well as accounts, securities, and other assets. Reflecting the concern of many in Congress that current civil penalties related to the export control and economic sanctions violations (normally, $10,000 to $11,000) do not sufficiently deter prohibited conduct, the Act authorizes civil penalties of up to $1,000,000.

John Suttle is working with Jan Wilson of our Toronto office to set the credit terms applicable to this entity on both the physical and financial trading side, but they have not yet made a final determination. In the interim, the G6 has requested that we send them a copy of our precedent form of master financial trading agreement (both the ISDA and our short form financial GTC). I assume you get requests like this all the time and was hoping that you could e-mail to me (i) the ISDA, credit support annex, Paragraph 13, etc. that we would typically put in place between ECC and a Canadian counterparty to financially trade gas and electricity in Canada (ie. incorporating the Canadian provisions), leaving the credit terms blank for the time being and (ii) the financial GTC we use for Canadian counterparties.

The following is the verbatim language from the Policy: \"Section VII. Miscellaneous Employee Trading. No employee may engage in the trading of any Position for the benefit of any party other than an Enron Company (whether for theri own account of thr the account of any third party) where such Position relates to (i) any financial instrument, security, financial asset or liability whch falls within such employee's responsibility at an Enron Compay or (ii) any other commodity included in any Commodity Group.\" Administration of this policy has been limited to the efforts of Mark Taylor and Tana Jones in the Legal Department primarily consisting of employees \"confessing\" to trading certain products. In the past, if the product has been one that Enron does not trade, the employee is told that it is ok. If it is a product that we do trade, then they are informed to comply with policy. Restrictions on the trading of financial instruments, such as equities, interest rates and foriegn exchange have been limited to those that are currently managing those books for an Enron Company or those who might have access to information that was not in the public domain. Generally, we have found that people have traded yen, S&P futures, metals and agricultural products. Now that we have authorized the trading of a wide variety of agricultural products and metals, we may need to advise employees not to trade them (immediately, soon, never???). We may also consider changing the policy or altering our enforcement methods. Please advise your guidance as to how to proceed.

The following is the verbatim language from the Policy: \"Section VII. Miscellaneous Employee Trading. No employee may engage in the trading of any Position for the benefit of any party other than an Enron Company (whether for theri own account of thr the account of any third party) where such Position relates to (i) any financial instrument, security, financial asset or liability whch falls within such employee's responsibility at an Enron Compay or (ii) any other commodity included in any Commodity Group.\" Administration of this policy has been limited to the efforts of Mark Taylor and Tana Jones in the Legal Department primarily consisting of employees \"confessing\" to trading certain products. In the past, if the product has been one that Enron does not trade, the employee is told that it is ok. If it is a product that we do trade, then they are informed to comply with policy. Restrictions on the trading of financial instruments, such as equities, interest rates and foriegn exchange have been limited to those that are currently managing those books for an Enron Company or those who might have access to information that was not in the public domain. Generally, we have found that people have traded yen, S&P futures, metals and agricultural products. Now that we have authorized the trading of a wide variety of agricultural products and metals, we may need to advise employees not to trade them (immediately, soon, never???).

As a part of this audit, one of my objectives is to become more familiar with the NYMEX Limits set for traders. Specifically I want to: 1. Ensure that the limits are correct 2. See appropriate action was taken to satisfy the request of the Trader (ie. If a request was made today to raise the limits, approval from the NYMEX should be obtained. and 3. I'd like to see all the documentation taking place between trader-Legal-Nymex. -- Does legal call NYMEX, or e-mail them? Please indicate the specific documentation involved. I realize that this is a bit vague, but I just wanted to give a heads up on what my basic objectives were. I was hoping that you could point me in the right direction, or perhaps let me know someone in your group from whom I can get further information. I certainly appreciate all of your help.

This has not been an issue for the Power Deal Clearing and Documentation Group because Ellen Wallumrod is from Norway. She is able to make 'confirms' in her native tongue. However, this is an issue from Global Contracts because no one can speak Norwegian! I have spoken with translation companies regarding translation fees. It is very costly to have all of the contracts translated. There are perhaps a dozen contracts. Should legal cover the translation expenses? Ian believes that only parts of the contract need to be translated. But, how do I know which parts need to be translated? And, with Auditors in mind, shouldn't we have English copies on hand? Do we need to have a complete English version ? If not, would it be acceptable to translate only certain paragraphs ?

This counterparty may elect to do additional financial trading under two divisions, its Core Procurement Department or its California Gas Transmission Department.

However, for regulatory purposes, payments cannot be netted between Pacific Gas & Electric Company and any/either of the two divisions. All payments must be treated separately. It is critical that the PAYMENT/SETTLEMENT GROUP captures this correctly. (CREDIT, the agreement does provide for closeout netting.) 2. Canadian and US Trades: All financial trades with this counterparty, whether entered in with Houston or Calgary traders must be done under this master agreement. THE CONFIRMATION DESK needs to make note of this. 3. GLOBAL CONTRACTS: When we open them up to trade online, we need to make sure that all of the financial products go under this master agreement. Under no circumstance should they see a GTC if they transact any financial product. 3. ONLINE TRADING: It is critical that the above information is captured correctly before we can open them up for online trading.

These financial statements reflect all of the North America trading operations. ECTEG1 is ENA's legal rollup within Hyperion and should reflect all of the North American trading (i.e., price risk management) activity. Therefore, Consolidated Reporting, with the assistance of Trading Accounting and Tax, prepared the financial statements with ECTEG1 activity. These financial statements are complete and ready for BA&R management review and reflect $722MM in earnings. However, as of 6/29, we were notified by the Tax department that three companies were included in ECTEG1 as of 12/31/99 that were no longer legal owned by ENA. In addition, there was one company that became ENA owned during 1999. The companies are as follows: Improperly Included: ECM Treasury Consolidated (Company 969) ECT Retail Services (Company 1Q6) ECT Power Marketing, Inc. - Retail (Company 890) Improperly Excluded: Enron Gas Liquids, Inc. (Company 104) I have corresponded with Tana Jones from the Legal department, Johnson Leo in Corporate Reporting, and Julie Gartner from the Tax department to determine if the financial statements that we prepared reflected accurate and complete North America trading activity. These discussions confirmed that the Hyperion legal structure was not accurately reflecting ENA's actual legal ownership. In addition, the three companies have $192MM in trading activity income that would be removed from the bottom line. This activity should probably be reported to the NYMEX (regardless of legal structure) as it represents price risk management activity. The primary issue is accuracy of the financial statements. We are prepared to have to restate the compiled financials as soon as we are notified where we can retrieve accurate ledger information. The other main issue is timing. We need to file these financial statements no later than July 21st. Before that can happen they need to be reviewed by several levels of management in several departments. The Legal department is currently reviewing the NYMEX requirements in order to determine the proper activity to report. As soon as that is determined, we can proceed with data retrieval.
